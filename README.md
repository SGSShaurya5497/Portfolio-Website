# ⚡ Shaurya Singh — Glitchcore / Cyberpunk Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a **glitch-infused**, **cyberpunk-styled** web experience built completely from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This isn’t your regular dev portfolio — it’s a fully animated, sound-reactive, dual-themed site inspired by **retro-futurism**, **glitch art**, and **80s hacker aesthetics**.  
Every pixel, transition, and beep was handcrafted by me.
